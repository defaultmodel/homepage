> I'm no russophone so there will be badly translated and badly misunderstood things

First of all Radio TCL is a music-only web radio station based in Kemerovo, Russia. 
There is little to no talking, no ads, no host, just... °˖✧✧˖°_**music**_°˖✧✧˖°

The complete name of Radio TCL is Radio Tёмная Сторона Луны , meaning "Radio dark side of the moon".\
Yes very much like one of the most influential piece of media, *The dark side of the moon* by *Pink Floyd*.

Radio TCL as the name suggests plays songs that usually don't get much air-time,
this music comes from a very big playlist that is alimented bi-weekly/monthly by what they call a mini-playlists.
Each mini-playlist being made up of 3-5 albums from which 2-3 tracks each are selected, each selection being accompanied by a review (*that you will have the joy of translating (^_~)* )

> SIDE NOTE : [Yandex Translate](https://translate.yandex.com/?source_lang=ru&target_lang=en) work best to translate from Russian into whatever, mind you, it is **russian controled** do not put personal information in there.

Note that they also play popular songs, today for example "*Klangkarussell Netzwerk (Falls Like Rain)*" was on.

## Listening to Radio TCL

The easiest way that I recommend is through [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden/listen/radio-temnaya-storona-luny/0prS57bF),
as it's a bliss to use and you make new discoveries by flying around the globe.

For anyone that would want to listen to Radio TCL elsewhere that on their website (e.g. Navidrome/Symphonium).
Here are all the ways I found to access the audio stream :
- https://a5.radioheart.ru:8049/dmoon (HTML \<video\> tag)
- https://a5.radioheart.ru:8049/json.xsl (XML)
- https://a5.radioheart.ru:8049/nonstop.m3u (M3U)
- https://a5.radioheart.ru:8049/nonstop.xspf (XSP)

> I'm not sure the XSP link works, when trying to open it in VLC I get an error about trying to reach `localhost:8049` to no avail

## A few finds

Let me list of the few finds I made while listening to TCL radio over the course of two months:
- *Thank You Goodbye* by Dengue Fever on Cannibal Courtship - 2011 [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/recording/ee766584-5afa-4673-af49-b8c9d6fef2b9)
- *Primitive Notion* by New Order on Get Ready - 2001 [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/recording/55b2c358-0d00-4293-8bed-e848fc0c0885)

Radio TCL is a non-profit organisation, and I don't think that because they are under a regime that is dubious at best,
world-endingly malevolent at worst, that they should suffer it's consequences.
